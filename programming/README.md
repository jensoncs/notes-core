# Programming Language

Computer can unserstand only binary language, 0 or 1

### Why computer builded in a way to only understand 0 or 1

Binary value has only two value and its easy to build in hardware level. Binary language which can understand computers is called machine language.The CPU ( Processor ) consist of millions of tiny components called transistors . A transistor can function either as amplifier OR a micro switch . The CPU makes use of transistors as micro switch . when this switch is on it represents Binary 1 and when this switch is off it represents binary 0 . And for this reason CPU understands only binary number system which makes use of only two numbers ( 0 & 1 ) to represent any value .

## Types of computer languages

1. Machine level language (Difficult to write beacuse you have to write language in a that computers can understand in 0s and 1s)

2. Assembly language :- Compare to machine level language it is easy to use and write.
   
   * e.g :  ADD 5 6 (If your checking how to code in 8086,8051) is the examples for assembly level language.
   * Assembler - will convert assembly level language to machine level langauge

3. Higher level language - Human readable language
   
   * Sample code sum = 5 + 6
To convert higher level languages to machine level langauge we have 2 methods

* Compilation (Compiler will be used)
* Interpretation (Interpreter will be used)

4. Middle level language

   * Its having all the fucntionalities of higher level langauge and you can directly work with computer memory and data.

## Compilation method

* Take higher level language and convert to machine level language and then the machine level code will be executed.
* Converting completly and executing.

## Interpretation method

* Interpreter will read the first line in the program and it will convert that in to machine code and will execute immediatedly.
* converting line by line and executing

## Static type language

e.g int a = 5

e.g string a = "5"

Data type will be decides on compiler time

Developer needs to takecare all the variable type

E.g : java, c, c++

## Dynamic type language

a = 5

a = "5"

Data type will be decided on execution type
Developer do not needs to take care any data type.

E.g : ruby, python..etc


## Compiler design

* Lexical Analysis - Convert programs in to token (Stream of token). lexical identifier using regular expression called pattern. Reading the program line by line
```
 pattern = l(l+d)* - a letter followed by letter or diggit
 
 l - letter
 d -digit
```
* Syntax analysis - Parser, Take the token and conver into parse tree (grammer)
```
Rules also called production

S -> id = E; (identifier is equal to expression and ;)
E -> E + T/T (expression can be a expression + term or term)
T -> T * F/F (term can be term * factor or factor)
F -> id

S - statement
id -identifier
E - Expression
T - Term
F - factor
```

* Semantic analysis - verify the parse tree is meaningfull or not

* Intermediate code generation - code generation is the process by which a compiler's code generator converts some intermediate representation of source code into a form (e.g., machine code) that can be readily executed by a machine.

Upto here for any compilers will be same.

* Code optimizer - reduce the size of the code.

* Target code generator - Code generation can be considered as the final phase of compilation. Through post code generation, optimization process can be applied on the code, but that can be seen as a part of code generation phase itself. The code generated by the compiler is an object code of some lower-level programming language, for example, assembly language. We have seen that the source code written in a higher-level language is transformed into a lower-level language that results in a lower-level object code, which should have the following minimum properties:

* Symbol table manager -  Symbol table is an important data structure created and maintained by compilers in order to store information about the occurrence of various entities such as variable names, function names, objects, classes, interfaces, etc. Symbol table is used by both the analysis and the synthesis parts of a compiler.

* Error handler - A parser should be able to detect and report any error in the program. It is expected that when an error is encountered, the parser should be able to handle it and carry on parsing the rest of the input. Mostly it is expected from the parser to check for errors but errors may be encountered at various stages of the compilation process. A program may have the following kinds of errors at various stages:
